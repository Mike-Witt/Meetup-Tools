Things to do: 

* When I run the M&S group I get what look like US zip codes in France, etc.
  So this is definitely not working right. MIGHT BE FIXED????

* Do the geo lookups in just one place. Probably make-dic

* Geo lookups when the location first goes in the dict [DONE?]

* Is there some way to explicitly feed the country code to geopy?
