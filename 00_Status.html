<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li> June 23: I'm deleting all the old programs.
    <br>They are all saved in "MeetupSoftware-2016.06.21" in my own
        "Releases" directory and in the github 0.0.0 release.

<li> July 14: Leaflet working somewhat, at least with DenverPhysics
<li> July 15: <b>Cleaning up -> new_make_map.py 
    / create_member_dictionary() done.</b>
</ul>

<h2>Things to do</h2>
<ul>
<li> BUG: Krakow, PL, shows up around Manchester GB.
<li> Is there some way to <i>explicitly</i> feed the country code to geopy?
<li> Look at Meetup API in ttd/meetup-code(?)
<li> Look at "how to use a schema.org postal address" in ttd/maps(?)
</ul>

<h2>General Scheme</h2>
<ul>
<li> The reason for the separate "member dictionary" and "location dictionary"
    is so that we can (in the member dict) maintain the original form of the
    information obtained from meetup, and try different techniques to parse
    it, without having to hit the meetup sites again.
<p>
<li> Right now <b>make-map</b> does everything, based on the flags given it:
    <br><code>./make-map -D my-group-name</code> basically does everything
    <br><code>./make-map my-group-name</code>
        will build everything if the member dict exists
    <br><code>./make-map -dm my-group-name</code> shows the member dict
    <br><code>./make-map -dl my-group-name</code> shows the location dict
</ul>
