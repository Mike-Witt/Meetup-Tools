<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li> June 23: I'm deleting all the old programes.
    <br>They are all saved in "MeetupSoftware-2016.06.21" in my own
        "Releases" directory (if not in Github). Same for the old 
</ul>

<h2>Things to do</h2>
<ul>
<li> BUG: Krak√≥w, PL, shows up around Manchester GB.
<li> Is there some way to <i>explicitly</i> feed the country code to geopy?
<li> Look at Meetup API in ttd/meetup-code
<li> Look at "how to use a schema.org postal address" in ttd/maps
</ul>

<h2>General Scheme</h2>
<ul>
<li> The reason for the separate "member dictionary" and "location dictionary"
    is so that we can (in the member dict) maintain the original form of the
    information obtained from meetup, and try different techniques to parse
    it, without having to hit the meetup sites again.
<p>
<li> <b>Make-Member-Dictionary.py</b> group-name
    <br>- Create dictionary with member info and "raw" meetup location string
    <br>- <b>This is the only code that needs to "scrape" meetup</b>
<p>
<li> <b>Make-Location-Dictionary.py</b> group-name
    <br>- Read a member dictionary and write a location dictionary
    <br>- Group members into locations
<p>
<li> <b>Find-Locations.py</b> group-name
    <br>- Does misc processing (eg: "unquote" names with "%" codes)
    <br>- Add geographic coordinates to a location dictionary
    <br>- <b>This is the only code that needs to access geo databases</b>
<p>
<li> <b>Map-Members.py</b> -flag group-name
    <br>- Read a location dictionary and write a .kml file
    <br>- This also does the sorting, merges duplicate locations, 
        and fixes "%" codes in city names (not in that order).
</ul>

What I want is something like this:
<pre>
# Meetup-Tools

## Summary

# Before Using:
```
pip install pyzipcode
pip install mechanize
pip install geopy
```

# To a make .kml file for the group called My-Group-Name:
```
./Make-Dictionary.py My-Group-Name
./Make-Map.py -bynum My-Group-Name
```
Then upload My-Group-Name.kml to Google Maps
</pre>
