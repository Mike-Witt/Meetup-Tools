<h2>Things to do</h2>
<ul>
<li> Is there some way to <i>explicitly</i> feed the country code to geopy?
<li> Look at Meetup API in ttd/meetup-code
<li> Look at "how to use a schema.org postal address" in ttd/maps
</ul>

<h2>New Scheme</h2>
<ul>
<li> <b>mtlib.py</b> - Common function and definitions
<p>
<li> <b>Dump-Member-Dictionary.py</b> group-name
    <br><b>Dump-Location-Dictionary.py</b> group-name
    <br>These two utilities can be used to examine the respective dictionaries.
<p>
<li> <b>Make-Member-Dictionary.py</b> group-name
    <br>- Create dictionary with member info and "raw" meetup location string
    <br>- This is the only code that needs to "scrape" meetup
<p>
<li> <b>Make-Location-Dictionary.py</b> group-name
    <br>- Read a member dictionary and write a location dictionary
    <br>- Group members into locations
<p>
<li> <b>Find-Locations.py</b> group-name
    <br>- Add geographic coordinates to a location dictionary
    <br>- This is the only code that needs to access geo databases
    <br>- Eliminate duplicate locations, merging the members
    <br>- Example, there are two different "londons"
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; key: meetup.com/cities/17/london/
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; key: meetup.com/cities/h9/london/
    <br>- I guess, for the time being, I'll merge things that map to the same geo coordinates. But I'll do some intelligent processing on that and have warning messages.
<p>
<li> <b>Map-Members.py</b> -flag group-name
    <br>- Read a location dictionary and write a .kml file
    <br>- This also does the sorting.
    <br>- SEMI-WORKING but there are some issues ...
</ul>

What I want is something like this:
<pre>
# Meetup-Tools

## Summary

# Before Using:
```
pip install pyzipcode
pip install mechanize
pip install geopy
```

# To a make .kml file for the group called My-Group-Name:
```
./Make-Dictionary.py My-Group-Name
./Make-Map.py -bynum My-Group-Name
```
Then upload My-Group-Name.kml to Google Maps
</pre>
