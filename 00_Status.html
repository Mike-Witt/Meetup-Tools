<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li> 20 July 2016: Somewhat cleaned up. <code>OLD-make-map.py</code> is the
    older version, which I'll save for comparison for a while.
</ul>

<h2>Things to do</h2>
<ul>
<li>I should use *everything but* the last name, as first_name.
    <br>- Examples: "Billy Jo" and "N. David"
<p>
<li> BUG: Krakow, PL, shows up around Manchester GB.
    <br>- Can't find a way to <i>explicitly</i> feed the country code to geopy
    <br>- But: ./GeopyTest.py 'Kraków, PL' / Get's the right answer!
    <br>Here's another one:
    <br>- Shows up just southwest of London, but ...
    <br>- ./GeopyTest.py 'Zürich, CH' / Zürich, Bezirk Zürich, Zürich, 
        Schweiz, Suisse, Svizzera, Svizra
    <br>So, maybe my "quoting" code is bad, or something like that?
</ul>

<h2>Misc.</h2>
<ul>
<li> The reason for the separate "member dictionary" and "location dictionary"
    is so that we can (in the member dict) maintain the original form of the
    information obtained from meetup, and try different techniques to parse
    it, without having to hit the meetup sites again.
</ul>

<h2>Example Group Names</h2>
<code>
<ul>
<li> Denver-Physics
<li> Virgina-Village-Eclectics
</ul>
