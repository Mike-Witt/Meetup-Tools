# Meetup-Tools

First of all: <b>THIS CODE IS NOT READY FOR USE YET!</b>

But if you want to help me test it out:

### Before Using:
```
pip install pyzipcode
pip install mechanize
pip install geopy
```

### To a make .kml file for the group called My-Group-Name:
```
./Make-Dictionary.py My-Group-Name
./Make-Map.py -bynum My-Group-Name
```
Then upload My-Group-Name.kml to Google Maps
