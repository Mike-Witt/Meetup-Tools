<h2>Mapping Meetup Groups</h2>

<h3>Warning</h3>

I'm working on this code right now. So some of the details of what's here will
have probably changed by the time you read this!

<h3>Motivation</h3>

I've often wondered where is the best place to hold meetups. Often I've
tried emailing an polling groups to ask in what part of town people live,
but I've never gotten much response to any of those queries.
<p>
I noticed that meetup member pages have the member's zip code on them.
It's not visible, but it's there. This gives a "reasonable" amount of
location information (as long as the person actually put in their correct
zip code).
<p>
So I had the idea that I might be able to do a little "webscraping" of
the member pages to get the zip code info, and then somehow map it out
on google maps, providing a geographic map of the group members. This
did end up working, at least to some extent.

<h3>What you need before you can run the code</h3>
First, you need to have all the "basic python stuff" installed.
    If you're not already using python you might want to do this 
    with "anaconda" which can be found at:
    <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">
    https://www.continuum.io/downloads</a>

Then, there are two additional things: <code>mechanize</code> which helps
    to download web pages in python, and <code>pyzipcode</code>, which
    translates US zip codes to geographic (longitude and latitude) coordinates.

<h3>The structure of the system</h3>
The system I ended up with has five elements:
<ol>
<li> A member dictionary file: <code>My-Group-Name.mdic</code>

<li> A location dictionary file: <code>My-Group-Name.ldic</code>

<li> A Keyhole markup language file: <code>My-Group-Name.kml</code>

<li> A google map of your group.

<li> A python program called <code>make_map.py</code> which does 
    the following things:
    <ul>
    <li> Scrape the web page which has the member list of your group
        and produce a ".mdic" file.
        This file contains a python dictionary that tells which 
        members are in which zip code.

    <li> Read the member dictionary and create a ".ldic" file.
        This file holds the location dictionary. Here the zip codes
        have been translated into geographic coordinates.

    <li> Read the location dictionary and sort it based on various options.
        Then and produc a ".kml" file. This file describes the map of your
        group.  KML is a markup language which can be uploaded to
        google maps (for example) to produce the actual map.
    </ul>
</ol>

<h3>Summary</h2>
  If you want to do this, you need to get a copy of 
    <code>make_map.py</code>. If you know
  how to use git, the repository is 
  <code>github.com/Mike-Witt/Meetup-Tools</code>. If you're not
    familiar with git, email me and I'll send you the code:
    msg2mw@gmail.com. 
<pre>
  pip install pyzipcode
  pip install mechanize
  ./make_map.py --download My-Group-Name
  ./make_map.py --geo My-Group-Name
  ./make_map.py --bynum --kml My-Group-Name
  Upload My-Group-Name.kml to google maps
</pre>

<h3>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li> I've only tested this with python 2.7.6, and I'm pretty sure it
    would not run as-is on python 3.

<li> The exact commands listed above are for Linux. There may be differences
    on other systems. There may be other reasons why this won't run on
    non-*nix type systems.

<li> Doesn't work with groups that are visible only to members.
    <p>
    I haven't yet figured out how to capture the cookie(s) that Meetup
    uses to determine whether you're logged in. So I can only do
    publicly visible member lists.

<li> Only works with with US groups
    <p>
    This program maps members based on zip (postal) codes. It appears that
    Meetup only uses these in the US, and uses city names elsewhere. I'm
    working on a non-US version. (Note: 20 July 2016 - It "sort of" works
    outside the US now, but there are some issues.)

<li> Only works for members who gave their correct zip code (obviously).

<li> Meetup may change the format of their pages any time. At best, this
    means tweaking the code for the new format. At worst, they might stop
    providing this information, obsoleting the whole process.
</ul>
